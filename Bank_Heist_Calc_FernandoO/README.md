# Heist Calculator
## Project Description
The Heist Calculator is a Java console application created for the SDC230 Programming Java final project. This program shows the use of loops, conditionals, user input, and basic object-oriented structure in a single menu-driven application. The calculator combines multiple features developed throughout the course into one complete working program.

The application allows users to select different calculation options from a menu. It uses counter-controlled loops and condition-based loops to perform calculations and keep running totals. The program accepts user input using the Scanner class and processes values based on the user’s selection. It also includes logic for tracking totals, counting entries, and evaluating postfix expressions.

This project demonstrates understanding of:
1. For loops
2. While loops
3. If/else statements
4. Methods and modular design
5. Running totals (accumulator pattern)
6. User input handling
7. Basic Java syntax and structure

To run the program, open the project in Visual Studio Code and Github

This project was done over several weeks, using instructor feedback to improve logic, formatting, and organization.
